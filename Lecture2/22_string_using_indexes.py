# str_name[start_idx:end_idx:step]

# start_idx is inclusive 
# if start_idx is not specified it is 0
# end_idx is enclusive 
# if end_idx is not specified it will be the index after the last (the length of a string)
# step sets how the index increments
# if step is not specified it is 1 by default

# examples

# if your start_idx is 0, you can omit it

# another example, these 3 achieve the same result

# changing the step
print(a[::2])

# also step can be reverse
